    <p>The first reccomendation for Youtubes website is it has a lot of Linked images missing alternative text, it is 1.1.1 Non-text Content-Level A. This means that an image without alternative text results in an empty link. This can be a problem because if an image contains no text and that image does not provide alternative text, a screen reader has no content to present to the user. To fix this you just have to add appropiate alternative text that presents the content of the image.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A second error the page has is Empty heading, it is 2.4.6 Heading and labels-level AA. This means that there are headings that contain no content. For some users, especially those with keyboard and screen readers, often navigate by heading elements. An empty heading will present no information and may be confusing. To fix this you can ensure that all headings contain informative content.</p>
