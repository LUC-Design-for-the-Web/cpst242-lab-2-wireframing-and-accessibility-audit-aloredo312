    <p>The first reccomendation for the Krispy Kreme website is to have a Page Titled, it is 2.4.2 Page Titled level A. This means page title is missing or not descriptive. Without this users who use screen readers or any other type of assistive technology will have a difficult time going through the page. Adding this will allow the web page to have titles that describe the topic or purpose of the site. A way to fix this is to provide a title using the title element and adding a breif, descrpitive page title.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A second error the page has is language is missing or invalid, it is 3.1.1 Language of Page  level A. This means that the language of the document is not identified or the lang attribute value is invalid. This can be a problem for the user because identifying the language of the page allows screen readers to read the content in the appropiate language. It also allows automatic translation of the content. To fix this you can use language attributes on the html element and ensure the lang attribute is valid.</p>
